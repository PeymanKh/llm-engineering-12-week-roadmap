# LLM Engineering — 12-Week Roadmap

This repository tracks my 12-week journey to master **LLM Engineering** and **Agentic AI**.  
Each week contains clear objectives, resources, a milestone project, and space for review.  
By the end, this repo will be both a **learning log** and a **portfolio** of completed projects.

---

## Repository Structure

- `weeks/week-01 ... week-12/` → Week-specific goals, checklists, and reviews  
- `projects/` → Milestone projects for each week  
- `notes/` → Personal notes, extra resources, reflections  
- `demos/` *(optional)* → GIFs, videos, and screenshots for each project  

---

## Weekly Rhythm

- **Monday** → Plan the week, set issues or checklist items  
- **Tue–Thu** → Build features, run experiments, take notes  
- **Friday** → Review + benchmark (latency, cost, quality, uptime)  
- **Saturday** → Demo project (video/gif, README updates)  
- **Sunday** → Rest / catch up  

Each week’s `README.md` ends with a **Weekly Review** section to capture outcomes and lessons learned.

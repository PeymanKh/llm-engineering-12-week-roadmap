# Week 03 — Agentic Design Patterns & Memory Systems

## 🎯 Objectives
- [ ] Master foundational agentic patterns  
- [ ] Implement ReAct, Reflexion, Self-Refine  
- [ ] Build sophisticated memory architectures  

## 📦 Deliverables
- [ ] Milestone project: **Intelligent Code Reviewer**  
- [ ] README updates  
- [ ] Advanced pattern + memory integration  

## 📆 Suggested Daily Plan

### Monday — ReAct Pattern
- **Morning (2h):** Read [Design Patterns for Building Agentic Workflows — Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/blog/dcarpintero/design-patterns-for-building-agentic-workflows) (ReAct section)  
- **Afternoon (3h):** Implement ReAct (reasoning + acting)  
- **Evening (1h):** Compare ReAct vs traditional approaches  
✅ **Deliverable:** ReAct agent that explains its reasoning  

### Tuesday — Reflexion & Self-Improvement
- **Morning (2h):** Read [Agentic Workflows — Emerging Architectures & Design Patterns (Vellum)](https://www.vellum.ai/blog/agentic-workflows-emerging-architectures-and-design-patterns) — Reflexion patterns  
- **Afternoon (3h):** Build self-reflecting, improving agent  
- **Evening (1h):** Test improvement capabilities  
✅ **Deliverable:** Agent that evaluates and enhances its responses  

### Wednesday — Advanced Patterns
- **Morning (2h):** Context-Augmentation & Evaluator-Optimizer  
- **Afternoon (3h):** Implement both patterns  
- **Evening (1h):** Benchmark pattern effectiveness  
✅ **Deliverables:** Two advanced pattern implementations  

### Thursday — Memory Architecture
- **Morning (2h):** Read [OpenAI — A Practical Guide to Building Agents (PDF)](https://cdn.openai.com/business-guides-and-resources/a-practical-guide-to-building-agents.pdf) (Memory systems section)  
- **Afternoon (3h):** Build short-term, long-term, episodic memory  
- **Evening (1h):** Test memory persistence & retrieval  
✅ **Deliverable:** Agent with sophisticated memory management  

### Friday — Pattern Integration
- **Morning (2h):** Combine patterns effectively  
- **Afternoon (3h):** Optimize pattern selection by task  
- **Evening (1h):** Create selection framework  
✅ **Deliverable:** Multi-pattern agent system  

### Saturday — Pattern Showcase Project
**Full-day (6h):** Build **Intelligent Code Reviewer** with:  
- ReAct analysis  
- Reflexion self-improvement  
- Memory architectures  
- Context-augmentation  

✅ **Milestone:** Code reviewer that learns & improves with each review session.
